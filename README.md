# Word Embedding and Search Query in NLP

### In this program, I created a task that ask for a search query and check through twitter tweets that the query exist in one of these tweets. The goal is to use word embedding with a GloVe model ( more about GloVe here : https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/).

### To create this program, I followed these steps : 

## 1- Preprocessing all these tweets. 
### Since they may have unconventional characters (emoticons, likes, hashtags), a specific preprocessing was used.

## 2- Applying word embedding by using the GloVe model

## 3- Applying word embeddings to the search query.

## 4- Calculate the cosine similarity and the Euclidean distance between the search query and each tweet of the dataset. 

## 5- Return the top 5 tweets with the smallest distance with each calculated method
